Once you have published your library to npm, you can import your library in any Angular application by running:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

// Import your library
import { SampleModule } from 'w2020-shared-library';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,

    // Specify your library as an import
    LibraryModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Once your library is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:

<!-- You can now use your library component in app.component.html -->
<h1>
  {{title}}

<sampleComponent></sampleComponent>
```
